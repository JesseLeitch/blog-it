blog-it
=======

This is the repository for my directed study application Blog It! The focus was on the back-end of the application and not the design. 

There are individual users who can create posts, view posts, and delete their own posts.
They are able to upload an avatar for their user.
Users can view other user's profiles where it will show them that user's posts.
Posts are able to have comments.

Existing bugs discovered 04/16/2015:
- If not signed in, trying to view a user's profile leads to an error.
- If signed in, viewing a users profile gives the illusion that you are posting as that user.

This app will be updated as I find time to learn more about the wonderful Ruby on Rails.
